		<description>Split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. Unlocks a complete gas infrastructure system for advanced power generation and life support.

Unlocks:
• Electrolysis Chambers - Convert water into H2 and O2 (500W/1500W/3000W variants)
• Hydrogen Fuel Cells - Clean power generation (1200W or 3000W, ~30% more efficient than chemfuel)
• Oxygen Generators - High-output power (1200W/2400W/4800W, 2x efficiency vs chemfuel, generates heat)
• Gas Storage Tanks - Buffer production/consumption (4 sizes for both gases)
• Oxygen Pumps - Life support for Odyssey gravships (requires DLC)

Power comparison:
• H2 Fuel Cells: Efficient, clean, no heat, acts as energy storage
• O2 Generators: 2x power output but generates 10-40 heat/sec (cooling required)

Requires dedicated pipe networks for hydrogen and oxygen distribution.</description>
